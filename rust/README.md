```console
$cargo new chatgpt
$cargo run --release or $cargo watch -x 'run --release'
$cargo fmt
$cargo add dotenvy
$cargo add async-openai
$cargo add tokio
$cargo add tracing-subscriber for examples
```

Even Better TOML

## TODO 

1. Make a simple CLI to decide which to use text or image?
2. Infinite with timer for text and image with SIGINT to close the CLI.
3. Include a blog post instead of this later
